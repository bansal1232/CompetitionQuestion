Given Sequential Array from -n to n and target number

Initially you are at element 0 of array. You have to find the minimum number of steps you will take to reach target number.

You can only jump left or right in array but with every move your jump count increases by one

Example :
Step 1: 1 jump to right or 1 jump to left
Step 2: 2 jumps to the right or 2 jumps to the left of where you are at right now.
Step 3: 3 jumps to the right or 3 jumps to the left of where you are at right now and so on.

.
Step n: n jumps to the right or n jumps to the left of where you are at right now and so on.

Example :
arr = [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3] , target = -2

output : 3

Explaination:

step 1 : 0-> -1 ( jump count = 1 )
step 2 : -1 -> 1 ( jumps count = 2 )
step 3 : 1 -> -2 ( jumps count = 3 )

we reach target element minimum 3 steps
